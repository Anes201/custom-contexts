Good — here’s a compact **score-only** table (1–10, higher = better) across the techs we discussed. No text columns, just numbers.

Legend:
Ecosystem = library/tools size; CLI = how ready for CLI tooling; Publish = ease of publishing; PackSize = small packaged binary (higher = smaller); Deps = low dependency bloat; Auto = automation/agent level; Resource = low RAM/CPU footprint.

| Tech         | Ecosystem | CLI | Publish | PackSize | Deps | Auto | Resource |
| ------------ | --------: | --: | ------: | -------: | ---: | ---: | -------: |
| Cargo / Rust |         4 |  10 |      10 |       10 |    9 |    6 |       10 |
| npm / Node   |        10 |   8 |       9 |        5 |    3 |    7 |        4 |
| pip / Python |         7 |   7 |       5 |        3 |    6 |    6 |        5 |
| OpenCode     |         6 |   8 |       5 |        5 |    5 |   10 |        6 |
| Gemini CLI   |         7 |   9 |       6 |        6 |    6 |    9 |        6 |
| Aider        |         6 |   8 |       6 |        6 |    6 |    7 |        6 |
| Tauri        |         6 |   8 |       8 |        9 |    8 |    6 |        8 |
| Electron     |        10 |   8 |       8 |        2 |    2 |    6 |        2 |
| Tkinter      |         5 |   5 |       7 |        7 |    9 |    4 |        9 |
| PyQt / Qt    |         6 |   5 |       5 |        5 |    5 |    4 |        5 |

If you want this exported as a CSV or small JSON for your notes, tell me which and I’ll output the exact file content.
