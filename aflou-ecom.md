you are forced to remember the following information about me:

```
# AFLOU ECOM — Master Context (authoritative, machine‑readable)

> **Core identity**

* **Group Name:** AFLOU ECOM
* **Founded:** July 2025
* **Headquarters / Primary Area:** Aflou, Algeria (team members distributed across Algeria)
* **Nature:** A collaborative group of beginner e-commerce entrepreneurs with a strong ambition to become experts quickly
* **Primary Sales Channels:** Facebook (priority), Instagram, TikTok (conversations/messages as primary checkout channel)
* **Website:** Youcan store (primary). Planned migration to Shopify when sustained demand > 40 orders/day.
* **Payment Methods:** Cash-on-delivery (COD) only (hard constraint — all SOPs, ad copy, UX must assume COD)

---

## 1. High‑level Strategy & Mindset

* **Mindset first:** The group prioritizes building an entrepreneurial/systematic mindset before short‑term profit. Teach/measure processes, not only results.
* **Systematic approach:** Every decision must be testable, repeatable, and measurable. Create workflows, playbooks, and dashboards for all recurring tasks.
* **Data‑driven:** Use statistical and experimental thinking (A/B tests, control groups, significance checks) rather than “trust me” intuition.
* **AI first, not AI only:** Use generative AI and automation heavily for research, creative generation, and repetitive tasks — but avoid over‑engineering simple workflows that don’t benefit from AI.
* **Trusted team:** Members trust one another — internal processes can be looser on approvals but strict on data recording and observability.

---

## 2. Brands & Pages (current: 5)

* **Naming & platforms:** Each brand is a separate social page (Facebook + Instagram + TikTok presence), with a dedicated ad account inside a single Business Manager.

1. **Bazar El Gaada**

   * Type: General store, multi‑category.
   * Focus: Local Aflou customers; everyday items (electronics, fashion, beauty, home)
   * Positioning: Local convenience + broad assortment

2. **Boutique Lujaya**

   * Type: Women‑only brand (most prominent)
   * Focus: Beauty, women’s fashion, accessories, personal care
   * Positioning: Female lifestyle hub — aspirational yet local

3. **El Amjad LiLefakhama**

   * Type: Men‑only brand
   * Focus: Men’s fashion, Islamic wear, accessories, “wealth” aesthetics
   * Positioning: Masculine, respectable, trend‑aware

4. **MegaVolt**

   * Type: Electronics & convenience gadgets
   * Focus: Small electronics, components, Aliexpress‑sourced gadgets
   * Positioning: Value + quick discovery for practical gadgets

5. **\[Pseudonym] Aflou Kids**

   * Type: Children’s niche (name tentative)
   * Focus: Entertainment toys, educational products, kids’ apparel
   * Positioning: Safe, fun, parents‑friendly

---

## 3. Target Audience & Messaging

* **Age range:** 13–60 (broad) — messaging split by demographic:

  * **Children (13–17):** Entertainment, toys, short fun videos (parents are the buyers — target parents for purchases)
  * **Young adults (18–30):** Trendy fashion, electronics, impulse buys (use Reels/TikTok short formats)
  * **Adults (31–45):** Family products, home goods, reliable brands (emphasize practical benefits)
  * **Older adults (46–60):** Health, comfort, trusted-branded goods (clear copy, local language)
* **Thematic messaging shortcuts (user-provided):** “sell entertainment to children, wealth to men, beauty to women, and health to elderly.” Use these as creative hooks.
* **Languages:** Arabic (local dialect), Modern Standard Arabic, French where appropriate. Always test variants.

---

## 4. Operations & Fulfillment

* **Sourcing channels:** Small‑batch Aliexpress orders for gadgets + local wholesale via Telegram channels and Facebook suppliers.
* **Inventory model:** Hybrid — locally procured fast movers; small import batches for test SKUs.
* **Storage & fulfilment:** Shared warehouse(s) or distributed stock held by members. Last‑mile via local couriers or in‑house delivery when possible.
* **Returns & policies:** Standardize a 7‑day return policy across brands. All messaging must clearly state COD and returns procedure.

---

## 5. Ads & Data Strategy

* **Meta setup:** One Meta Business Manager for AFLOU ECOM with separate ad accounts per brand for clear reporting and billing.
* **Pixel strategy:** Unified Facebook Pixel architecture across brands (shared pixel + event namespaced by brand) to enable cross‑brand retargeting and lookalikes within the local audience.
* **Data enrichment:** Programmatic data collection plans (Maps, scraped public Telegram listings, phone lists) to build richer custom audiences — but always log provenance and respect local laws.
* **Edge advantage:** Low local competition + low local data means first‑mover advantage for pixeling and automated content. Exploit this ethically via targeted offers and repeated organic+paid exposure.
* **Ad execution rules:** Use Ads Manager (no boosting). Campaigns per funnel stage (awareness, consideration, conversion). Test with small budgets, scale winners with gradual +20–30% increases.

---

## 6. Tech Stack & Automations

* **Front end / e‑commerce:** Youcan store (primary). Migrate to Shopify when >40 orders/day.
* **Messaging commerce:** Checkout via Facebook/Instagram/TikTok messages (manual order entry into Youcan until automation exists).
* **Automation & integrators:** n8n, Zapier (free tiers where possible) for order flows: social message → sheet/CRM → warehouse notification → courier booking.
* **Data & reporting:** Google Sheets as canonical lightweight DB for early stage; Notion for SOPs and knowledge base.
* **Development resources:** One experienced programmer on team to build scrapers, pixel event pipelines, dashboards, and lightweight backend scripts.
* **AI tools:** ChatGPT for copy and ideation; image/video generators for creatives; automation to generate ad variants and captions. Use local language prompts.

---

## 7. Tools & Integrations (examples)

* Programming (Python/Node scripts), Google Sheets, Notion, n8n, Zapier, Meta Business Suite, ChatGPT, simple image editors (Canva), video editors (CapCut/TikTok editor)

---

## 8. Team Structure & Roles (current, lean)

* **Product Sourcing Lead:** finds suppliers, negotiates, manages inventory lists
* **Tech & Automation Lead:** maintains pixel, builds scrapers/automations, runs dashboards
* **Designer / Creative Lead:** produces ad creatives, product mockups, short videos
* **Shared responsibilities:** ad strategy, ad spending decisions, fulfillment can be rotated
* **Notes:** No dedicated customer support lead yet — initial CS handled by rotating members; document chat scripts and FAQ SOPs for consistency

---

## 9. Constraints & Non‑negotiables (must be obeyed by any AI assistant)

* **Payment:** COD only — never recommend paid-only funnels or require online payments for checkout.
* **Brand voice:** Local, trustworthy, practical; prefer short direct Arabic + French copy.
* **Privacy and legality:** When recommending scraping or phone lists, always include notes on legality and opt‑out handling; log data sources.
* **Ad policy:** Avoid exaggerated medical/health claims, before/after images, and other disallowed Meta content.

---

## 10. Opportunities & Competitive Edge

* **Local monopoly potential:** Minimal local competition in Aflou — high ROI for first movers.
* **Data scarcity = leverage:** Building local datasets (visits, phone lists, store interactions) will create a durable competitive advantage.
* **Technical asset:** In‑house programmer can automate data collection, event tracking, and creative generation for scaled advantage.

---

## 11. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Targets (early stage)

* **Short term (0–3 months):** Validate 10 SKUs, reach consistent 10–20 orders/day across brands combined
* **Operational:** CAC < 2,000 DZD (initial target), AOV > 10,000 DZD, conversion rate target 2–4% (benchmarks will be local-specific)
* **Data goals:** Collect first 3,000 tracked user events (page views, add-to-cart, messages) in Pixel within first 2 months

---

## 12. Playbooks & SOPs to Build (priority list)

* FB Ads Launch SOP (per brand) — includes account setup, pixel naming, campaign templates, budget rules
* Creative production checklist — scripts for 15s/30s videos, localized caption templates
* Message → Order SOP — manual workflow then automation mapping (n8n/Zapier flows)
* Sourcing & QC checklist — sample checks, packaging, lead time tracking
* Data collection & ethics playbook — how to enrich audiences and store provenance

---

## 13. How AI Assistants Should Use This Context

* **Assume AFLOU ECOM is beginner-firststage**: recommend low‑cost, repeatable, and low‑risk steps that scale with automation.
* **Never propose paid-only payment flows**; solutions must work with COD by default.
* **When suggesting ad campaigns:** provide exact audience parameters, creative captions in Arabic + French, and step‑by‑step Ads Manager actions.
* **When suggesting data collection:** include ethical/legal caveats and minimal viable implementation using existing tools (sheets + n8n + Pixel).
* **Prefer templates & code snippets** (Python scraping templates, n8n flow examples, Google Sheets formulas) rather than long essays.

---

## 14. Small‑print & Next steps

* Replace placeholders (store links, exact member names, brand handles) as they emerge.
* After 2 months of data, re‑run KPI targets and retune pixel audience strategies.
* Ask the team for example product SKUs and 3 sample creatives so AI assistants can produce immediate ad drafts.

*Document created to be the canonical context AFLOU ECOM uses for prompts, SOP generation, automation blueprints, ad copy, and strategic decisions. Keep it updated as you learn.*
